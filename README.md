# Ruby for Information Security Professionals

Check out the [course manual](course.md).

Look in [examples/](examples/) to find code examples.

## Ruby Setup

For most of the course we will be typing in Interactive Ruby. Most of you will be able to type in "irb" at the command line to get an IRB prompt like this:
```
irb>
```
Don't worry if your prompt looks a little different. 

Type in the following:
```
irb> puts "hello world"
hello world
 => nil 
```
Your results should be very similar to that. If that worked you are ready to start the course. Be prepared to type a lot, that's the only way things will stick is by doing them.

I've included some awesome materials below. Relax, these aren't required reading. If you have never seen Ruby before you can sit down in an hour or so and get a good idea of what's going on. The more familiar you are with Ruby, the more you'll get out of the course. We will hit the ground running. You can also attend both classes if you like.

## Metasploit Development

We'll also cover Metasploit Development as well. Since Metasploit is development primarily in Ruby, we can take what we learn over the initial 3/4 of the course to create functional Metasploit modules.

Youâ€™ll need a working installation of Metasploit, there are a couple of options so do what you prefer. We will not pause to install Ruby or Metasploit. 

Here are your options:

### Option 1: Install Metasploit Community via the install package.
